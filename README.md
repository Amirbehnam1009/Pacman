# Pacman


A Python implementation of artificial intelligence search algorithms to solve problems within the Berkeley Pac-Man environment. The Pac-Man Projects, developed at UC Berkeley, apply Artificial Intelligence concepts to the famous arcade game.



__1.Search__

Search: Implemented Depth-first (DFS), breadth-first (BFS), uniform cost, A* search algorithms and Greedy Search. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in Pacman.

__2.Multi Agent Search__

Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
  
__3.Reinforcement Learning__

Reinforcement Learning: Implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
